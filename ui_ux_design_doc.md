## Purpose and Scope

The Project Liminality application is designed to provide a visual and interactive platform for managing and connecting ideas, projects, and resources. It serves as a digital representation of a user's thought processes and creative workflows.

Key aspects of the application include:

1. Dreamnode Management: Users can create, view, and interact with "dreamnodes," which represent individual ideas, projects, or resources.

2. Visual Representation: The application presents dreamnodes in a visually appealing and intuitive interface, allowing users to see connections and relationships between different elements.

3. Metadata and Categorization: Each dreamnode contains metadata such as creation date, modification date, and interaction count. Users can categorize dreamnodes as either "ideas" or "persons."

4. Relationship Mapping: Users can establish and visualize connections between different dreamnodes, creating a web of interrelated concepts and resources.

5. File Integration: The application supports various file formats (including images and documents) associated with dreamnodes, allowing users to attach relevant media to their ideas.

6. Search and Sort Functionality: Users can easily find and organize their dreamnodes through search and various sorting methods.

7. External Tool Integration: The application provides functionality to open dreamnodes in external applications such as Finder, GitFox, Keynote, Cinema 4D, and Sublime Text.

The scope of the application is to provide a comprehensive tool for creative professionals, researchers, and anyone who needs to organize complex ideas and projects in a visually intuitive manner. It aims to bridge the gap between traditional note-taking applications and more complex project management tools, offering a unique, visually-driven approach to idea organization and development.
