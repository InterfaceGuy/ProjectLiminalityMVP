## Purpose and Scope

Project Liminality is designed to provide a framework that allows users to create digital representations of ideas and stories that human beings carry in their interior and wish to share with others. The vision of Project Liminality is to provide digital infrastructure that enables people to share ideas in the most natural way possible, drawing inspiration from our indigenous roots and ancient methods of sharing ideas around campfires through face-to-face, free-flowing conversations.

Project Liminality serves as a conversational co-pilot, centered around video calls or actual face-to-face conversations. It explores a dialogos-centric web, contrasting with the current monologos-centric internet, which is vulnerable to propaganda. The overarching goal is to return to a dialogos-centric approach while utilizing monologos to enhance the dialogos.

Key aspects of Project Liminality include:

1. Dreamnode Management: The fundamental unit of Project Liminality. Users can create, view, and interact with "dreamnodes," which represent individual ideas, projects, or persons.

2. Dream Talk and Dream Song: Each dreamnode has a front side (Dream Talk) and a back side (Dream Song). Dream Talk is a minimalist, potentially animated SVG-based symbol representing an idea. Dream Song is a linear thread of Dream Talks, weaving multiple ideas into a larger story.

3. Visual Representation: The application presents dreamnodes in a visually appealing and intuitive interface, allowing users to see connections and relationships between different elements in a holarchical structure.

4. Git-based Architecture: Each dreamnode is a Git repository, allowing for version control and collaboration. Dream Songs can import Dream Talks from other dreamnodes using Git submodules.

5. Person-Idea Relationship: Dreamnodes can represent either ideas or persons, allowing users to visualize shared vocabularies and connections between people and concepts.

6. Local and Agent-centric: Users maintain their own set of dreamnodes, representing their personal perspective and memetic horizon.

7. Coherence Beacon: A mechanism for expanding one's idea network through resonant connections with friends.

8. Dream Weaving: The process of playing with ideas and weaving them together into larger wholes.

The scope of Project Liminality is to provide a comprehensive tool for anyone who wishes to organize, develop, and share complex ideas in a more natural, conversation-centric manner. It aims to bridge the gap between ancient storytelling traditions and modern digital capabilities, offering a unique, visually-driven approach to idea organization and development that fosters genuine human connection and understanding.
